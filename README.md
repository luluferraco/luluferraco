### hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm always learning. really believe in kindness and attention to details. awaken dreamer and big time Apple fan.

it all started as a student of iOS development in the Apple Developer Academy at PUC Rio.
currently I work as a software engineer @nubank messing around with any code they let me mess around. ðŸ™ƒ

nowadays I review more PRs than open them. I've been focusing more in people and how to help them (often enough with code :).
if you think I can help you somehow, reach me out through any of the channels below my pic.
