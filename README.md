### hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm always learning. I believe in kindness and attention to details. Awaken dreamer and big time Apple fan.

It all started as an iOS development student at the Apple Developer Academy - PUC Rio.
Currently a Engineer Manager @nubank ðŸ’œ

Nowadays I review more PRs than open them. I've been focusing more in people and how to help them (often enough with code :).
If you think I can help you somehow, feel free to reach out :)
